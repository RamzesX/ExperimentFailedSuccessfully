# Ghost of Tsushima, but It's Sandomierz Mode

*Or: Father Mateusz and the Thirteenth-Century Mystery*

---

## I. Kurosawa Mode

The game has an option in the menu.

"Kurosawa Mode" — you turn it on and the image becomes black and white, film grain from the fifties, sound slightly muffled as if through old cinema speakers. An American studio — Sucker Punch, from Seattle — made a game about Japanese history so faithfully that Tsushima Island granted them honorary citizenship.

You play Jin Sakai, the last living samurai after the Mongol invasion of 1274. Your uncle, Lord Shimura, teaches you honor — fight face to face, don't hide, don't poison, don't strike from shadow. This is the way of the samurai. The warrior's path.

And then the Mongols slaughter all your people. And you must choose: honor or effectiveness. Die with honor or survive as a *ghost*.

Jin chooses shadow. Poison. Knife in the back. He ceases to be a samurai — becomes a legend the Mongols fear. Ghost of Tsushima.

But this isn't a game review.

This is the question Father Mateusz has been asking himself for three days, sitting in the parish archive in Sandomierz, poring over documents from the thirteenth century.

*Why did the Mongols stop?*

---

## II. The Mystery

Year 1241. Battle of Legnica.

Duke Henry II the Pious dies. His army shattered. The Mongols cut an ear from every corpse — nine sacks of ears sent to the Khan as proof of victory. The road west lies open. Nothing stands in their way.

And they turn back.

Historians say: death of the Great Khan Ögedei, necessity of returning for the kurultai. Perhaps. Probably. But Father Mateusz has learned over the years that official explanations are rarely the whole truth.

Because thirty-three years later — 1274 — the Mongols attack Japan. Tsushima Island falls first. Massacre. The samurai fight honorably, one on one, introducing themselves before each duel. The Mongols shoot arrows. They don't understand the rules. Or they understand and couldn't care less.

The fleet sails on. And then — typhoon. *Kamikaze*. Divine wind.

1281 — they try again. Larger fleet. Better preparation.

Larger typhoon.

The Mongols, who conquered everything from Korea to Baghdad, from China to Rus' — stop at two ends of Eurasia. Poland and Japan. Forty years apart. Eight thousand kilometers between them. Same result.

Father Mateusz closes the chronicle. Removes his glasses. Rubs his eyes.

*"This cannot be coincidence,"* he thinks. *"But what is it?"*

---

## III. Wajda Mode

There's a video on YouTube.

"POTOP anime opening (REUPLOAD)" — ten thousand views. Someone took scenes from Hoffman's film and edited them in the style of a Japanese anime opening. The title "RZECZPOSPOLITO" in sunset colors, Japanese characters at the bottom, characters arranged like a shōnen series key visual.

And in the middle — a black and white frame with Japanese text:

*"この映画は、ヘンリク・シェンキェヴィチの小説「大洪水」を翻案したものです。"*

"This film is an adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel 'The Deluge.'"

Father Mateusz doesn't know Japanese. But he recognizes something in the aesthetic. Something familiar.

Because Andrzej Wajda — the same Wajda who made "Katyń" — studied Kurosawa. And Kurosawa studied Ford. And Ford loved Monument Valley the way Wajda loved the Polish plains. And somewhere in this chain, across decades and continents, the same river flows.

The execution scene in "Katyń." Polish officers, one by one, shot in the back of the head, body falls into the pit. No hysteria. No begging. They walk to death *upright*.

The seppuku scene in Kobayashi's "Harakiri." The samurai kneels, blade enters belly, the second waits with sword. No hesitation. Ritual. Dignity. Acceptance of the inevitable without loss of self.

The same aesthetic.

The same people, eight hundred years and eight thousand kilometers apart, speaking the same language that Father Mateusz cannot yet name.

---

## IV. The Orphans

There's a story they don't teach in schools.

1919. Siberia. Civil war in Russia. Thousands of Polish children — orphans of exiles, of soldiers, of families scattered by Tsarist and Bolshevik chaos — dying of hunger and disease.

Japan sends ships.

Not for profit. Not for politics. Japanese women — officers' wives, aristocrats, ordinary mothers — collect money, organize transport, welcome Polish orphans into Japanese homes. Feed them. Heal them. Teach them. Love them.

765 children.

Some stay in Japan. Some return to Poland. All remember.

When the 1995 earthquake devastates Kobe, Poland — poor, post-communist, barely standing Poland — sends aid. And in the process finds old photographs, letters, documents. Finds those who remember.

A little girl who in 1920 received a doll from a Japanese family is now ninety years old. She still has it.

Father Mateusz reads about this in the archive and has to stop. Goes out to the courtyard. Lights a cigarette he quit ten years ago.

*These aren't coincidences*, he thinks. *This is a pattern.*

---

## V. The War That Wasn't

1941. Japan joins the Axis. Germany demands Japan declare war on all of Britain's allies.

Japan declares war on Britain. USA. Netherlands. Australia.

Not Poland.

The official explanation is vague. Japanese diplomacy speaks of "no direct conflict of interests." But there are witnesses — Japanese officers who after the war said informally:

*"We could not declare war on Poland. It would have been dishonorable."*

Could not. Not "didn't want to" — *could not*. As if there existed a law higher than the Axis, higher than alliances, higher than politics. A law that says: *certain opponents you do not attack, because it would shame you.*

Like a samurai who won't finish off a wounded enemy, because it would be beneath his dignity.

Like a knight who grants safe passage to a messenger, because honor demands it.

Like something Father Mateusz cannot name but recognizes in his gut.

*How did they know?*, he thinks. *How did they know we were... kin?*

---

## VI. The Sword

There's a graphic novel. Manga. Called *Kimetsu no Yaiba* — "Demon Slayer." The hero fights demons that devour humans with a sword. Every demon slayer has their style, their techniques, their breathing.

The internet made a meme:

*"Ottoman Slayer Blade, my favorite rice story."*

Because there's a book by Sienkiewicz — a trilogy — and in it there's a knight. Michał Wołodyjowski. Small, unassuming, the finest swordsman in the Commonwealth. His blade sings through the air so fast that opponents don't see the cuts. Kills Turks, Cossacks, Tatars — but not from hatred. From duty. From honor. From love for a country that is falling apart.

At the end, at Kamieniec Podolski, when all is lost, when there's nothing left to defend — Wołodyjowski ignites the powder magazine. Blows himself up so the enemy won't pass.

His last word: *"Nic to!"*

It doesn't translate. "It's nothing" is too dismissive. "So be it" is too passive. The closest might be: *"No matter."* But said while walking into death. Said as acceptance without surrender.

And Jacek Kaczmarski wrote a song about it that Father Mateusz can't get out of his head:

*"To heaven flies the Little Knight*
*Blown to pieces by the blast"*

*"To heaven — it's closest from Poland"*

Father Mateusz closes his eyes and sees: a samurai on a bridge, surrounded by Mongols, knows he'll die, walks forward. A knight in the powder magazine, surrounded by Turks, knows he'll die, lights the fuse.

The same moment. The same decision. The same word — spoken in Polish as *"Nic to!"*, in Japanese as *覚悟. Kakugo.*

Readiness. Acceptance. The decision already made.

*"I know I'll die. It doesn't matter. I'm going."*

---

## VII. The Poet

Wisława Szymborska sells in Japan like manga.

This isn't a metaphor. Her volumes reach print runs that in Poland are reserved for crime novels. The Japanese translate her, quote her, memorize her.

Why?

Because Szymborska writes like haiku. Precision. Minimalism. Depth in simplicity. Zero ornamentation. Every word weighs.

*"We know ourselves only as far as we've been tested."*

That could be carved on a samurai's blade.

And Chopin — more pianists playing Chopin in Japan than anywhere outside Poland. The Chopin Competition in Warsaw as pilgrimage. Japanese laureates who weep playing nocturnes, because they understand something they cannot put into words.

What do they understand?

Father Mateusz thinks of Musashi — the samurai who at the end of his life stopped fighting and began to paint. His paintings of birds made with the same brushstroke as sword cuts. Transcendence. Form flowing from emptiness.

Chopin — sick, dying, far from Poland which he could not see — writing a nocturne that sounds like the breath of someone who knows they'll soon stop breathing. But writing it *beautifully*. Not despite death — *through* death. As if dying were just another note in the composition.

*Beauty and death intertwined*, thinks Father Mateusz. *In them and in us. The same aesthetic. The same code.*

---

## VIII. The Trumpet Call

Kraków. St. Mary's Tower. A trumpeter plays the hejnał.

Every hour, for seven hundred years. The same melody. The same moment of interruption — where, according to legend, a Tatar arrow lodged in the trumpeter's throat in 1241.

Not a "memorial." Not a "museum." *Living artifact*. Daily. "Someone died for us. We remember. The melody breaks, but WE play on."

What other city has a seven-hundred-year continuous ritual of the same memory?

Japanese temples. Where monks repeat the same sutras for a thousand years. Where festivals follow identical patterns since the Heian era. Where memory is not the past — it is *the present repeated*.

The Mongols saw this in 1241. And again in 1274.

They saw people who don't die when you kill them.

Because their culture says: *dying is easy. Living is hard. But remembering — that is immortality.*

---

## IX. The Answer

On the third day, at three in the morning, Father Mateusz wakes with the answer.

Not one answer — because such mysteries don't have one answer. But answer enough.

The Mongols conquered everything that could be conquered by force. Armies that surrendered. Cities that negotiated. Empires that had something to lose and preferred to lose less.

But at two ends of Eurasia they met something different.

They met people who lost battles and didn't stop fighting. Who lost dukes and chose new ones. Who had no one to negotiate with, because no one had the mandate to capitulate.

They met a culture of honor, in which death was cheaper than shame.

*"You killed our duke. No matter. The next one comes."*

*"You killed our samurai. No matter. His son comes."*

The Mongols knew death. But they didn't know this. They didn't know people who cannot be *defeated*, even when they are *beaten*.

And at the edge of empire, at the ocean's shore and Europe's gates, someone made a decision:

*"Here is the border. Further isn't worth it."*

---

## X. Recognition

Father Mateusz goes to the kitchen to make tea.

And on the way, walking through the dark corridor of the rectory, he says aloud:

*"鬼滅の刃"*

Kimetsu no Yaiba. Demon Slayer. Ottoman Slayer Blade.

He says it in Japanese and doesn't even know where he learned those words.

And then he understands that he hasn't solved the mystery. That the mystery has solved *him*.

Because for three days he read about Poland and Japan, about Mongols and samurai, about Chopin and Kurosawa, about Szymborska and haiku, about the trumpet call and festivals — and somewhere in all of it the boundary blurred.

There is no "us" and "them." There is *recognition*.

A Japanese tourist stands in Kraków, listens to the hejnał, and weeps without reason.

A Pole plays Ghost of Tsushima, sees the samurai on the bridge, and feels something in his chest.

Szymborska sells in Tokyo because the Japanese read her and think: *"she knows."*

Wajda films Katyń, and the Japanese need no explanation — they understand why the officers didn't beg.

*Recognition.*

Not fascination with the exotic. Not curiosity about the foreign. Deeper.

*"We have an uncle. On the other side of the world. Eight hundred years ago we said the same word at the same moment. NO."*

---

## XI. "No Matter"

The same word. Two languages.

*"I will die. No matter. But I will die moving forward."*

Wołodyjowski at Kamieniec. The trumpeter on St. Mary's tower. The Warsaw insurgents. Father Popiełuszko. Solidarity.

Jin Sakai on Tsushima. The forty-seven ronin. The samurai at Sekigahara. The monks of Enryaku-ji.

Same phrase. Same meaning. Same path.

*"I know the price. I pay it. I go."*

---

## XII. Symphony

Kaczmarski wrote:

*"But 'no matter' — death, or 'no matter' — life?*
*Skirmishes, scouting, and love affairs?*
*To heaven flies the Little Knight,*
*To heaven — it's closest from Poland."*

And further:

*"The soldier didn't know his own wisdom*
*Busy with Basia and his saber:*
*Not to doubt, to believe in sacrifice's meaning*
*Is an easy thing — sometimes a great one."*

Because this is the key Father Mateusz sought for three days.

Wołodyjowski wasn't a philosopher. He didn't sit over treatises on honor. He loved a woman, felt the saber in his hand, defended the walls because that was his job. *Busy with Basia and his saber.*

Jin Sakai wasn't a philosopher. He was a warrior who did what was necessary to protect the island.

Neither would say: *I am a symbol of my nation's honor.*

Both would say: *I do what must be done.*

And that's precisely why they are symbols. That's precisely why we remember them. Because they didn't try to be remembered — they tried to do their job well, even when that job cost their lives.

*Not to doubt, to believe in sacrifice's meaning / Is an easy thing — sometimes a great one.*

---

## XIII. Wałęsa

1990. Lech Wałęsa, newly elected president, says:

*"Poland will be a second Japan."*

Everyone laughs. Poland — bankrupt after communism, with empty shops and six hundred percent inflation — a second Japan? With that baggage?

And then 1990-2020:
- Polish GDP ×6
- Only EU economy without recession in 2008
- Transformation from USSR satellite to EU's sixth economy

Not Japan. But similar trajectory.

A ruined, humiliated country that stands up and *works*.

Because Wałęsa — an uneducated electrician from Gdańsk — understood something the economists didn't see. He understood that Poland and Japan have the same code:

*Destroyed but not broken. Beaten but not defeated. We fall and we rise.*

And that this code is worth more than all the IMF loans put together.

---

## XIV. Ghost of Tsushima, but It's Sandomierz Mode

There's a scene in the game.

Jin Sakai stands over the graves of his people. They all died defending the beach. He survived because he was unconscious. And now he must choose: fight on as a samurai — honorably, openly, doomed to lose — or become a ghost. A shadow. A killer from ambush.

If you turn on Kurosawa Mode, this scene looks like a frame from "Seven Samurai."

But Father Mateusz sees something else.

He sees Czarniecki, leading hussars across the frozen Baltic, because the sea is now a road.

He sees the Home Army, fighting in the sewers of Warsaw, because the streets are no longer defensible.

He sees the January insurgents, hanging from trees, because against an imperial army you can only fight from hiding.

*Ghost of Tsushima, but it's Sandomierz Mode.*

Someone made it. On the internet there's an anime opening from The Deluge. Japanese subtitles on a Polish film. Because the internet sensed what Father Mateusz just understood:

*It's the same story.*

A samurai who must abandon honor to save his people.

A knight who must blow himself up to stop the enemy.

Both cultures know this moment. Both cultures mourn it. And both cultures understand it.

*Dying is easy. Living is hard. But sometimes you must choose a third option: die so that others may live.*

---

## XV. Final Scene

In the morning Father Mateusz returns to the archive.

Not to find anything more — he's found enough. To sit in silence among documents that are eight hundred years old, and pay them respect.

Because these aren't papers. These are the voices of people who died so we could sit here. Polish knights at Legnica. Japanese samurai on Tsushima. Monks who copied chronicles. The trumpeter who played to the end.

*To heaven — it's closest from Poland.*

Or from Tsushima. It's the same height.

Father Mateusz folds his hands — not for prayer, for a bow. In Japanese it would be called *rei* — a bow of respect between equals.

Because now he understands: there is no mystery to solve.

There is only recognition.

Two nations at two ends of the world, who eight hundred years ago said "no" to the same force. And since then carry the same code in their bones.

They don't know about each other. They don't need to. The code is the same.

Remove Chopin from the piano — Musashi with his brush remains.

Remove Wajda from the camera — Kurosawa remains.

Remove Wołodyjowski from the powder magazine — Jin Sakai on the bridge remains.

*No matter.*

---

## Epilogue: To the Reader

This essay is not a history lecture.

It is an attempt to tell something I feel but cannot prove.

At Legnica, real people died. On Tsushima, real people died. At Katyń, in Warsaw, in Hiroshima — real people. Not symbols. Not metaphors. People who had names, families, plans for a future they would never see.

I don't want to use them for an essay.

I want to honor them.

Because if there is something that unites us — Poles and Japanese, living and dead, readers and writers — it is this:

*We remember.*

Not because someone told us to. Not because it's politically correct. We remember because *that's what you do*. Because it's part of who we are.

The trumpet call breaks — but we play on.

The sword shatters — but the next smith forges another.

The duke falls — but the next one comes.

*"No matter."*

And that is the answer to the thirteenth-century mystery Father Mateusz sought for three days:

The Mongols stopped because they met people who cannot be stopped.
