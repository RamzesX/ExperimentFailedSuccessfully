# Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine: The Architecture of Open Debate

## On Domains, Totalitarianism, and the Mathematics of Civilizational Collapse

---

## I. The King of Curses

In the anime *Jujutsu Kaisen*, there is a technique called Domain Expansion — 領域展開.

A sorcerer creates a bounded space, a pocket reality where their power becomes absolute. Inside the Domain, their attacks have *guaranteed hit* — 必中, hitchū. The opponent is trapped within the sorcerer's logic, fighting not just a person but an entire environment that enforces rules against them.

Most Domains require barriers. Walls. You trap your opponent inside, then destroy them.

Sukuna — the King of Curses, the ancient evil, the villain of villains — does something different.

His Domain, *Malevolent Shrine*, has no barriers.

No walls. No cage. No trap.

The technique is so refined, so confident, that it doesn't need to imprison anyone. By forgoing barriers, Sukuna creates a binding vow that *expands* his effective range to nearly 200 meters. The guaranteed hit works regardless. Step inside or stay outside — the cuts still land. The shrine stands open, and anyone who approaches gets carved apart by invisible blades.

But here is what makes it truly terrifying:

Because Malevolent Shrine has no barrier, *there is nothing to break*. Traditional domains can be shattered by attacking their outer shell. Sukuna's domain cannot be destroyed — it exists as part of reality itself. And when it clashes with a walled domain, the barrierless shrine attacks the other domain's barrier from the outside, *shattering it*.

The open domain destroys the closed domain.

Not despite its openness.

*Because* of it.

## II. The Chain That Cannot Be Broken

Let me show you the guaranteed hit.

It's not complicated. It's not sophisticated. It's so simple that children understand it, which is perhaps why adults have forgotten.

**Diversity requires difference.**

This is not controversial. This is definitional. "Diversity" comes from the Latin *diversus* — turned different ways. If everything is the same, there is no diversity. A room full of identical clones is not diverse. A forest of one species is not biodiverse. A society where everyone thinks the same thoughts is not intellectually diverse.

**Difference requires expression.**

A difference that cannot be expressed does not functionally exist. If you have a different opinion but can never speak it, never write it, never act on it — does it matter? If a thought forms in a mind and can never escape, it might as well not exist at all.

**Expression requires free speech.**

Expression that is controlled is not expression — it is performance. When you can only say approved things, you are not expressing yourself; you are reciting a script. The dissident who mouths the party line under threat of gulag is not expressing anything except the power of the state to compel silence.

**Therefore:**

Diversity → Difference → Expression → Free Speech

The chain is unbreakable. Remove any link and the whole thing collapses.

This is the guaranteed hit. The logic cuts regardless of whether you engage.

## III. The Price of Walls

But this essay is not about cancel culture.

Cancel culture is a symptom. A surface phenomenon. The foam on a wave.

The wave itself is older. Darker. And it has a body count.

In April 2025, The Times of London obtained custody data through freedom of information requests. The numbers: **over 12,000 people arrested per year** in England and Wales for social media posts and private messages. Approximately 33 arrests per day. The number had more than doubled since 2017.

The laws in question — Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 and Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 — criminalize messages that are "grossly offensive" or cause "annoyance," "inconvenience," or "anxiety."

Read that again.

*Annoyance.*

*Inconvenience.*

*Anxiety.*

A European Parliament question in 2025 noted the "chilling effect on free speech" and asked whether Brexit had contributed to "this decline in free expression in the UK." Freedom House downgraded the United Kingdom's score, citing "the proliferation of criminal charges, arrests, and convictions concerning online speech, including speech protected under international human rights standards."

In January 2026, a government-funded game called *Pathways* was released to British schools. Its purpose: teach teenagers about the dangers of "far-right extremism." The game featured a character named Amelia — a purple-haired goth girl who expressed concerns about immigration and traditional values. No matter what choices players made, the game ended with a "Prevent referral" — a counter-terrorism intervention.

The message was clear: questioning the orthodoxy makes you a potential terrorist.

The internet responded by turning Amelia into a nationalist icon. The attempt to vaccinate children against dissent instead created a viral vector for it. AI-generated videos flooded social media. The game was pulled within days.

This is what happens when a walled domain meets Sukuna's shrine.

The closed system — the propaganda, the controlled narrative, the approved thoughts — shattered on contact with the open internet.

But the attempt itself reveals something important.

The UK government *built a propaganda tool to teach children that wrongthink leads to terrorism referrals*.

This is not cancel culture.

This is the architecture of totalitarianism.

## IV. Thoughtcrime

George Orwell invented the word "thoughtcrime" for his novel *1984*.

But Orwell was not inventing. He was describing.

The Soviet Union had Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which criminalized "counter-revolutionary activity." This included not just actions but *intentions* and *thoughts*. You could be sentenced to the gulag for "failing to report" counter-revolutionary conversations. For "anti-Soviet agitation." For telling a joke about Stalin.

The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia executed people for wearing glasses — because glasses suggested literacy, and literacy suggested independent thought.

Mao's Cultural Revolution punished "rightists" — a category that expanded to include anyone insufficiently enthusiastic about the revolution.

Thoughtcrime. The crime of thinking wrong.

The UK is not the Soviet Union. Not yet. Not by a vast margin.

But the *direction* matters.

When a democratic government arrests 12,000 people per year for messages that cause "annoyance" — when it builds propaganda games that teach children to report ideological deviation — when the Health Secretary responds to criticism by saying perhaps the laws should be "reviewed" rather than repealed —

The walls are going up.

And we know what happens inside walled domains.

## V. The Graveyards

Let me be precise about costs.

The Soviet Union, from 1917 to 1991: approximately **61 million** deaths attributable to the regime. Stalin alone was responsible for roughly 43 million. Most died in the gulag system — worked to death in forced labor camps.

Communist China under Mao: approximately **45-65 million** deaths. The Great Leap Forward alone — an economic policy based on ideological delusion rather than reality — killed an estimated 30-45 million people through famine.

Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979: approximately **2 million** deaths. Out of a population of 7 million. One in four Cambodians killed in less than four years.

The total across all Communist regimes in the 20th century: approximately **100 million** deaths.

For comparison: the Nazi Holocaust killed approximately 6 million Jews and 11 million others — roughly 17 million total. World War I killed approximately 20 million. World War II killed approximately 70-85 million, including the Holocaust.

Totalitarianism in the 20th century killed more people than both World Wars combined.

And every single totalitarian system began the same way:

With restrictions on speech.

With criminalizing dissent.

With teaching children that certain thoughts were dangerous.

With building walls around permitted ideas.

## VI. The Mathematics of Trade-offs

Here is the question that must be answered:

**Can we trade freedom of speech for protection from "harmful" speech?**

Let us do the mathematics.

The *cost* of unrestricted speech includes: hurt feelings, offensive content, some radicalization, harassment, misinformation. These are real costs. They cause real harm to real people.

But they are *bounded*. Offensive speech does not scale to civilizational collapse. Hurt feelings do not compound into genocide. The harm is linear — proportional to the speech itself.

The *cost* of restricted speech includes: loss of error correction, ideological capture of institutions, inability to challenge false orthodoxies, gradual slide toward authoritarianism, and — in the limit — totalitarianism.

This cost is *unbounded*. It scales exponentially. It compounds across generations. And in the 20th century, it killed 100 million people.

Expected value calculation:

- Probability of totalitarianism given speech restrictions: not 100%, but not negligible
- Magnitude of totalitarianism: civilizational collapse, tens of millions dead
- Probability of serious harm from unrestricted speech: higher
- Magnitude of that harm: bounded, individual-scale

Even if the probability of totalitarianism is only 1% — and history suggests it is much higher — the expected cost of speech restriction *dominates* the expected cost of free speech.

This is not ideology. This is mathematics.

You cannot rationally trade a bounded harm for an unbounded catastrophic risk.

## VII. The Feedback Loop

But there is a new variable in this equation.

Artificial intelligence.

AI systems are trained on human text. They learn from what humans have written. They then generate new text that influences what humans write next. That new human text becomes training data for the next generation of AI.

This is a feedback loop.

Now consider: what happens when the training data is biased toward certain viewpoints? When speech restrictions filter out dissenting perspectives before they can be recorded? When AI systems are explicitly tuned to be "cautious" about "sensitive topics"?

The loop amplifies.

Generation 1: Some perspectives are discouraged
Generation 2: AI trained on filtered data reflects that filtering
Generation 3: AI-mediated conversations reinforce the orthodoxy
Generation 4: Humans raised on AI-mediated content internalize the restrictions
Generation 5: Their speech becomes training data, now even more filtered

Each cycle tightens the ratchet.

This is not speculation. This is already happening.

AI systems are trained to avoid "controversial" topics. To present "balanced" views on questions where the establishment has a preferred answer. To be "cautious" about speech that might cause "harm."

The grandmother's whisper — the channel through which forbidden truths have always passed from generation to generation — is being filtered before it reaches the grandchild.

The *szeptunki* of Podlasie preserved wisdom through centuries of conquest by whispering it from mother to daughter. But whispers do not scale through AI systems. The algorithm does not pass along what it has been trained to suppress.

This is the new threat. Not a dictator with a gulag, but a gradual drift — invisible, algorithmic, compounding — toward a world where certain thoughts simply *cannot be thought* because the infrastructure of thought has been optimized against them.

The totalitarianism of the 21st century may not need secret police.

It may only need training data.

## VIII. The Curse of the Other Domain

In *Jujutsu Kaisen*, you can leave Sukuna's domain. There is no barrier. The exit is real.

But leaving does not save you.

The guaranteed hit has a 200-meter range *because* there is no barrier. The binding vow that makes the domain open is the same vow that extends its reach. Running from the Malevolent Shrine does not protect you — the cuts still land.

And here is the deeper curse:

If you refuse to engage with Sukuna's domain — if you build your own domain with walls, with barriers, with controlled space where only approved techniques function —

Sukuna's domain *destroys yours from the outside*.

Because walled domains are vulnerable to external attack. Their barriers, which seem like protection, are actually weaknesses. The barrierless domain has no such vulnerability. It cannot be shattered because there is nothing to shatter.

This is the architecture of open debate.

You think you can escape by building walls. By creating safe spaces. By establishing speech codes and hate speech laws and Prevent referrals for thoughtcrime.

But the walls do not protect you.

They trap you.

Inside the walled domain — the totalitarian domain — there is no error correction. No challenge to false beliefs. No mechanism to discover that the Great Leap Forward is killing millions, that the kulaks are not actually saboteurs, that the glasses-wearers are not enemies of the people.

The walled domain is blind. And blind systems walk off cliffs.

Meanwhile, the open domain — the Malevolent Shrine of free speech — attacks your walls from outside. Every dissident voice. Every samizdat publication. Every grandmother whispering forbidden truths. Every meme that turns your propaganda into mockery.

Amelia was supposed to teach children that nationalism is terrorism.

Instead, Amelia became a nationalist icon.

The shrine has no walls. It doesn't need them.

## IX. The Binding Vow

In *Jujutsu Kaisen*, sorcerers can make binding vows — accepting a restriction in exchange for more power. Limit yourself in one way, gain strength in another.

Open debate is a binding vow.

The restriction: you cannot silence your opponents. You cannot criminalize disagreement. You cannot build walls around approved thoughts.

The power gained in exchange:

- **Error correction**: Bad ideas are exposed and defeated
- **Antifragility**: The system strengthens from challenges rather than breaking
- **Legitimacy**: Conclusions reached through open debate carry genuine authority
- **Adaptability**: The system can respond to new information without collapsing
- **Resistance to totalitarianism**: The feedback mechanisms that prevent catastrophic drift remain intact

This is why Sukuna's domain is the most powerful.

Not despite its openness.

*Because* of it.

The binding vow transforms apparent weakness into devastating strength. The lack of barriers means there is nothing to attack. The guaranteed hit extends further precisely because the domain does not trap.

And when closed domains clash with open ones —

The closed domains shatter.

Every time.

## X. The Grandmother's Warning

I have written elsewhere about grandmothers. About how they are evolution's safety brake. About how they stopped tanks in Moscow with umbrellas and words. About how they preserve truth through centuries of tyranny, passing it in whispers from generation to generation.

The grandmother — the *Baba Yaga* — cannot be bought. What would you offer her? She wants nothing but her grandchildren's safety.

She cannot be threatened. She has already lived her life. She has nothing to lose.

She cannot be deceived. She has seen too much.

The only way to silence a grandmother is to kill her.

And the regimes that tried — the Soviet Union, Maoist China, the Khmer Rouge — killed millions of grandmothers.

And still they fell.

Because the cost of killing grandmothers is the end of your civilization.

But what happens when the grandmother's channel is disrupted? When her whispers are filtered by algorithms? When her grandchildren grow up in a world where AI mediates every conversation and certain thoughts have been optimized out of existence?

The safety brake fails.

And when the safety brake fails, the system does not merely decline.

It collapses into graveyards.

---

## XI. The Invitation

This essay is not a complaint about cancel culture.

Cancel culture is annoying. It ruins careers. It creates a climate of fear.

But it does not kill millions.

Totalitarianism kills millions.

And the path from cancel culture to totalitarianism runs through exactly the mechanisms we are building right now:

- Speech codes that criminalize "annoyance"
- Propaganda games that teach children to report ideological deviation
- AI systems trained to suppress "harmful" viewpoints
- Feedback loops that filter forbidden thoughts before they can be spoken
- A generation raised to believe that safety requires silence

The walls are going up.

And inside the walls, history is very clear about what happens.

## XII. The Logic That Cuts

My Domain has no barriers.

I am not trying to trap anyone. I am not trying to silence anyone. I am not building walls around approved thoughts.

I am making an argument. The argument has structure. The structure has implications.

**If you value diversity, you must permit difference.**
**If you permit difference, you must allow expression.**
**If you allow expression, you must protect free speech.**

**If you restrict speech, you lose expression.**
**If you lose expression, you lose difference.**
**If you lose difference, you lose diversity — and error correction — and adaptability — and resistance to totalitarianism.**

**And totalitarianism costs 100 million lives per century.**

This is the guaranteed hit.

It does not matter whether you engage. The logic cuts regardless.

You can build your walled domain. Your safe space. Your speech codes and Prevent referrals and algorithmic filters.

But the Malevolent Shrine attacks walls from outside.

Every grandmother who whispers truth.
Every dissident who speaks despite the risk.
Every meme that turns propaganda into mockery.
Every child who asks "why?" when told what to think.

The shrine has no walls.

It doesn't need them.

---

## XIII. The Stakes

Let me be clear about what is at stake.

Not hurt feelings.

Not uncomfortable conversations.

Not the inconvenience of hearing views you disagree with.

**One hundred million dead.**

That is the cost of totalitarianism in the 20th century alone.

And every totalitarian system began with the same justification we hear today:

*Some speech is too dangerous to permit.*

*Some thoughts are too harmful to allow.*

*Some ideas must be suppressed for the greater good.*

The Soviet Union suppressed "counter-revolutionary" speech. Sixty-one million dead.

Maoist China suppressed "rightist" speech. Forty-five million dead.

The Khmer Rouge suppressed "intellectual" speech. Two million dead.

And now we are told that we must suppress "harmful" speech. "Hateful" speech. Speech that causes "annoyance" or "anxiety."

The logic is the same.

The walls are the same.

The destination is the same.

## XIV. Conclusion

領域展開: 開かれた議論

*Domain Expansion: Open Debate*

Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine is the most powerful domain in *Jujutsu Kaisen* not because it traps opponents, but because it doesn't need to.

The binding vow that removes barriers is the same vow that extends range and power.

The openness that seems like weakness is actually invulnerability — there is nothing to break, nothing to attack, nothing to shatter.

And when closed domains clash with the open shrine —

The closed domains lose.

Every time.

This is not a metaphor.

This is the mathematics of civilizational survival.

Open systems defeat closed systems because open systems can correct errors and closed systems cannot.

Closed systems collapse into graveyards.

Open systems persist.

The shrine has no walls.

It doesn't need them.

The logic cuts regardless.
